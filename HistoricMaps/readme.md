## Bringing Historical Maps into the Digital Age

[ArcGIS] (http://www.arcgis.com/features/), [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/), and [Tilemill] (https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/) are three GIS technologies that can help you make and serve out a beautiful map (historic or otherwise). In this workshop we will cover the basics of [georeferencing] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georeference) a map of your choosing, bring it into Tilemill for styling, and upload it to Mapbox. By the end of this short class, you will be able to serve out a map on your own.
