###Gaming in the Academy?

*Just some highlights. Feel free to submit pull requests with other key moments.*

  * [Game Studies: International Journal of Computer Game Research](http://gamestudies.org/), the "first academic, peer-reviewed journal dedicated to computer game studies," commences publication in 2001.
  
  *  [DiGRA](http://www.digra.org/) (Digital Games Research Association), an "association for academics and professionals who research digital games and associated phenomena," is founded in 2003.

  * Starting in 2008, the American Library Association sponsors the [International Games Day](http://igd.ala.org/) on the third Saturday every November.
  
  * Also in 2008, Scott Nicholson, Associate Professor at the School of Information Studies, founds the Library Game Lab at Syracuse University. He now
directs its successor, [Because Play Matters Game Lab](http://becauseplaymatters.com/) 
 	
  * In 2013, Jay Clayton, William R. Kenan Jr. Professor of English at Vanderbilt University, teaches the first MOOC on online gaming: [Online Games: Literature, New Media, and Narrative](https://www.coursera.org/course/onlinegames)

###Exploring [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/)

  * [Markus Persson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markus_Persson), a.k.a. "Notch," is the lead developer of Minecraft. [Mojang](https://mojang.com/), an independent game studio until its [acquisition by Microsoft in 2014](http://news.microsoft.com/2014/09/15/minecraft-to-join-microsoft/) launched the beta version of Minecraft in 2009 and the release version in 2011.
  
  * Minecraft is an [Open World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_world) style game, meaning that there aren't well-defined goals or narratives. The Minecraft game environment is frequently compared to an online LegoÂ® set. 

  * Minecraft is a client/server application. While it is possible to play the game on your own machine, a lot of the fun comes from interacting with other players on Minecraft servers.
  
  * Minecraft offers several [game modes](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Gameplay). We'll be working in Creative Mode, which means that won't be inadvertently killed by creepers or skeletons. 

###Modding Minecraft with [CanaryMod](http://canarymod.net/)

  * Minecraft is written in [Java](https://www.java.com/en/). "Mods" (modifications) allow users to change the underlying game environment.
  
  * The legal environment for creating mods is very complex; the [recent controversy](http://www.programmableweb.com/news/minecraft-server-software-and-modding-plug-ins-facing-uncertain-future/analysis/2014/09/24) afflicting the popular [CraftBukkit](https://github.com/Bukkit) mod serves as an example of the licensing challenges.
  
  * [CanaryMod](http://canarymod.net/) allows you to write Java code to interact with the Minecraft Server. Since CanaryMod runs on the JVM, it's also possible to write mods in [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) and [Clojure](https://github.com/cpmcdaniel/CanaryClojureLibrary). You can also write CanaryMod mods in [JavaScript](https://github.com/walterhiggins/ScriptCraft/). 
  
  * [Learn to Program Minecraft with Minecraft Plugins](https://pragprog.com/book/ahmine2/learn-to-program-with-minecraft-plugins) by Andy Hunt provides a great introduction to both Java and CanaryMod.

###Making Minecraft Maps with [WorldPainter](http://www.worldpainter.net/)

 * How to create a new world
 * Edit custom settings
 * Download and import [custom toolbrushes](http://www.worldpainter.net/trac/wiki/CustomBrushes)
 
   * More [custom brushes](http://www.planetminecraft.com/project/six-epic-world-painter-custom-brushes/)
 * Create custom terrain
 * Other downloadable modifications: [Trees](http://www.planetminecraft.com/project/native-trees-of-europe-template-repository-1779952/)

####Exporting Your Map from WorldPainter to CanaryMod

 * From WorldPainter toolbar file-->export-->export as new Minecraft map
 * Open the map in Singleplayer mode in Minecraft
 * Hit [esc], then "Save and Quit to Title"
 * Navigate to your Minecraft saved games folder
   * On a Mac, it's ```/Users/[USER]/Library/Application Support/minecraft/saves```
 * Copy the folder with the name of your world from the saved games folder in your Minecraft application director to the worlds folder in your CanaryMod server directory.
 * Restart CanaryMod
 * Load the new world by issuing the command ```/loadworld [NAME] normal```
 * Switch to the new world by issuing the command ```/spawn [NAME] [USER]```

###Wrapping Up

* Our goal for our [Dean's Fellow Project](http://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/about/deansfellowsprojects2015.php) is to create a representation of campus in Minecraft.
