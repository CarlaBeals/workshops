##What is a Podcast?
What makes a podcast a podcast? What's the difference between podcasts, broadcasts, and webcasts? Let's list some characteristics of podcasts.

##Audacity
Let's take a look at Audacity.

* Close the project and open it again. 
* Export the audio to MP3.

##Activites

4. Edit this file. Remove some of the silence between voice audio in the Examples/DynamicMic.mp3 file.
2. Try [this editing recipe](http://www.buzzsprout.com/blog/2014/05/02/
