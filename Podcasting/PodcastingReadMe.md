##What is a Podcast?
What makes a podcast a podcast? What's the difference between podcasts, broadcasts, and webcasts? Let's list some characteristics of podcasts.

##Audacity
Let's take a look at Audacity. I have created some example files for us to work with. All the examples feature a dry signal from the mic. No added effects or editing have been applied to the audio. Check the [Examples folder](https://github.com/EdWarga/workshops/tree/master/Podcasting/Examples).

* Open this file in Audacity: [EdwargaPodcastIntroOutro.mp3](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5qrNoxFaFhueTdzQmlmMEItb2s/view?usp=sharing)
* Save as an Audacity project (.aup). 
* Close the project and open it again. 
* Export the audio to MP3.

##Activites
1. Listen to the five mic test files ([iPhone](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5qrNoxFaFhuelVDeGNwWG15Yk0/view?usp=sharing), [Internal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5qrNoxFaFhubzFSR1BGR3VQWEU/view?usp=sharing), [HeadSet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5qrNoxFaFhuMXhFa0Q5d1MwRkU/view?usp=sharing), [Dynamic](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5qrNoxFaFhuTExhcFpYRkxtSm8/view?usp=sharing), [Yeti](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5qrNoxFaFhuXzh3MndYQjVrNW8/view?usp=sharing)).Which one sounds best?
4. Edit this file. Remove some of the silence between the audio in [DynamicMic.mp3](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5qrNoxFaFhuTExhcFpYRkxtSm8/view?usp=sharing)
2. Try [this editing recipe](http://www.buzzsprout.com/blog/2014/05/02/how-to-get-the-best-sounding-audio-for-your-podcast) on EdwargaPodcastIntroOutro
3. Add music to EdwargaPodcastIntroOutro. Here's a track from SoundCloud with a CC license: 
5. Record a test track of your own. Try recording a short introduction to your own podcast. Record the audio, apply the [editing recipe](http://www.buzzsprout.com/blog/2014/05/02/how-to-get-the-best-sounding-audio-for-your-podcast), add some music, and export the track as an MP3.
