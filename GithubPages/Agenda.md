##Workshop Description

Did you know it’s possible to host a website freely using your GitHub repository? We’ll show you how to use GitHub Pages to create a static HTML website with all the benefits of version control. We’ll also take a look at Jekyll, a tool for generating websites from Markdown. By the end, you’ll be ready to roll your own website for coursework or scholarly projects.
