# Curating Digital Collections #

##Introduction
###What is a Digital Collection?
* collection: an accumulation of objects gathered for study, comparison, or exhibition ([Merriam-Webster](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/collection))
* digital: of, relating to, or being data in the form of especially binary digits ([Merriam-Webster](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/digital))
* Digital Collection: a collection of objects (digitized or born digital) stored in digital formats and accessible over a network.
* Examples: Library, Museum, Archive, Research

###What is Omeka?
Omeka is a web publishing platform for sharing digital collections and building online exhibits with the items in these collections. Omega might be a good solution for a digital archive, research collection, student research and course work, prototyping larger digital projects. It is not a blogging platform or preservation system. It is a quick way to put up a website to showcase a digital collection.

##Getting Started
In this workshop we will learn how to create a free Omeka site, start a digital collection, and build an online exhibit. Here are a few key concepts to get you started with Omeka. Links to documentation provide more detailed support.
#### Managing Items
* An item is a digital file(s) and its metadata record.
* An item can be included in one collection, or no collection.
* For information on how to manage items in Omeka, see: [http://omeka.org/codex/Managing_Items](http://omeka.org/codex/Managing_Items)
* [Use this guide when inputting metadata](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W3QFz1HYHDCv5ieEVkrqPfhAvyHdFvzgjmyfiOar2yE/edit#gid=0)
* You may want to tag items: [http://omeka.org/codex/Managing_Tags](http://omeka.org/codex/Managing_Tags)
 
#### Managing Collections
* A collection is a group of items. Items may only belong to one collection a time.
* A collection has a metadata record describing it.
* For information on how to manage collections in Omeka, see: [http://omeka.org/codex/Managing_Collections](http://omeka.org/codex/Managing_Collections)

#### Building Exhibits
* The Exhibit Builder plug allows you to build online exhibits using items in your collections.
* An exhibit is a set of webpages that showcase a combination of digital objects in your Omeka archive with narrative text.
* Exhibits are built using the Omeka dashboard. Click the "exhibits" link in the left nav column to get started.
* For information on how to manage exhibits in Omeka, see: [http://omeka.org/codex/Plugins/ExhibitBuilder](http://omeka.org/codex/Plugins/ExhibitBuilder)

#### Metadata
* Metadata is information about an object (data about data). It allows users to discover, identify, and locate items. It also enables systems to sort and filter items to present during search and browse operations.
* In Omeka you can create metadata for collections and objects. 
* Omeka uses a metadata standard called Dublin Core. It is a set of elements used to describe an item. Some elements include Creator, Date, Title, Publisher, Description, and Rights.
* Other metadata standards can be used in Omeka with some configuration and customization.
* Along with content files, metadata is a standard part of a digital object.

####Simple Pages
* Another Omeka plugin that allows site managers to create simple webpages on there site.
* Use cases include about pages, contact pages, and the like.

####Customization
* With any system like this, out of the box will only get you so far. Customization will be necessary to take your project to the next level. Web development skills should get you there (PHP, CSS).
* You can switch themes for a different look. [http://omeka.org/codex/Themes](http://omeka.org/codex/Themes) 

####Support
* You will find documentation and forums on the Omeka website: [Omeka.org](Omeka.org)

####4. Install Plugins
* Navigate to the plugins area of your Dashboard. Click the green **Install** button next to the following plugins.
	* Exhibit builder
	* CSV Import
	* Simple Pages
![#18](https://github.com/EdWarga/workshops/blob/master/Curating%20Digital%20Collections/screenShots/Screen%20Shot%2018.png)

####5. Upload a Batch of Items
* With the CSV Import plugin you just installed, you can upload a batch of items at once. Very handy!
* Item files must be on the public Web. Today we are using image files posted on the Smithsonian American Art Museum's website. Alternately you could use a service like Dropbox or Box to meet this requirement, or a Web enabled directory.
* I transferred the metadata for these items to a [CSV file](https://github.com/EdWarga/workshops/blob/master/Curating%20Digital%20Collections/OmekaWkshpCollection.csv) along with the path to the item files. 
* [You can download the CSV file here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5qrNoxFaFhuYi1QWV9mZUtYMmc/view?usp=sharing). Save to the desktop.
* From the Dashboard interface:
	* choose the CSV Import tab, 
	* Choose the CSV file you just saved to the Desktop
	* Check appropriate settings and select the next button
	* Set the mapping settings and click the Import CSV File button
	* Use the Status tab to check status of import and undo import at any time.
