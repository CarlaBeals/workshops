# Practice Assignment for Pandoc

This document is written in markdown. Try converting it to another markup format.

Markdown is lots of fun.

I can create a bulleted list of items:
* Bullets are fun
* I'm all about list making
* I really enjoying crossing things off lists

Or a numbered list:
1. This is so easy
2. You should try it

I can make my text **bold** or *italics* for emphasis

I can even make tables:

### Fall and Winter Holidays ###

| September | October | November | December | January |
| ------ | ------- | --------- | -------- | ------ |
| Labor Day | Columbus Day | Veteran's Day | Chanukah | New Year's Day |
| Rosh Hashanah | Yom Kippur | Thanksgiving | Christmas | Epiphany
| Autumnal Exquinox | Halloween | Black Friday | Kwanza | Martin Luther King Day
