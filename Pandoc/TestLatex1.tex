\section{Let's Do Some Math}

\LaTeX{} can be used to write all sorts of fun mathematical formulas.


\subsection*{Let's play with formulas}

Does anyone remember this formula?

$a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}$

If the length of both \emph{a }and \emph{b} are known, then \emph{c}
can be calculated as 

$c=\sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}}$

If the length of the hypotenuse \emph{c} and of one side (\emph{a}
or \emph{b}) are known, then the length of the other side can be calculated
as

$a=\sqrt{c^{2}-b^{2}}$

or

$b=\sqrt{c^{2}-a^{2}}$
