##Directions
1.  Open ArcMap
2.  Add your data (map witout spatial reference and a basemap with spatial reference).
*Note-- In order for your map to work in TileMill your map must be referenced in [WGS1984](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System).  This requires either using a basemap that is done in WGS1984 for referencing or reproejcting your data into WGS1984 once you are finished.
3.  Right click in the blank space at the top of the tool bar and select "Georeferencing"
4.  Open the "View link table", this will allow you to see the control points you add and remove them if necessary.  You can also make final transformations oand adjustments by using this window.
5.  Click the "add control points" button.  You will begin by adding a known control point to the map that has no spatial reference and continue by mathcing a control point on the basemap that has a spatial reference.
6.  Once you have added at leat 4 control points, click the "Georeferencing" dropdown and selec "Update Georeferencing"
7.  If your map has not been referenced in WGS1984 now is the time to reproject your data.
