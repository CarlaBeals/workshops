#Textual Encoding Workshop

The goal of this workshop is to introduce students to marking up documents with structured markup languages like [TEI P5](http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/P5/) and [JATS](http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/).

##Text Encoding Initiative

Let's consider how to markup H.P. Lovecraft's short story, ["The Statement of Randolph Carter"](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Avon_Fantasy_Reader/Issue_10/The_Statement_of_Randolph_Carter). How would you represent this document as [plain text](TEI/Randolph_Carter.txt), [HTML](TEI/Randolph_Carter.html), [ePub](TEI/Randolph_Carter.epub)? Here's how it might be rendered in very simple [TEI](TEI/Randolph-Carter.xml). How could we improve its representation?
