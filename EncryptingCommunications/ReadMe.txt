**On password strength**, I forgot to mention that the xkcd password (“correcthorsebatterystaple”) isn’t actually very good.  Not just because it’s been made popular by xkcd, but because linking a few dictionary terms together is something that password hackers do regularly when they’re trying to crack passwords.

Something like “Wotstw!Baum1900” (“We’re off to see the wizard! Baum, 1900”) is much stronger, according to that Ars Technica article.  Password hackers might eventually guess it, but not for a while.  Password strength is all relative—you want to be in the last 2% or so of passwords to get cracked, because most hackers will have stopped trying by then.
