##Getting Started
Here are a few key concepts to get you started with Omeka. Links to documentation provide more detailed support.
#### Managing Items
* An item is a digital file(s) and its metadata record.
* An item can be included in one collection, or no collection.
* For information on how to manage items in Omeka, see: [http://omeka.org/codex/Managing_Items]()
* [Use this guide when inputting metadata](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W3QFz1HYHDCv5ieEVkrqPfhAvyHdFvzgjmyfiOar2yE/edit#gid=0)
* You may want to tag items: [http://omeka.org/codex/Managing_Tags]()
 
#### Managing Collections
* A collection is a group of items. Items may only belong to one collection a time.
* A collection has a metadata record describing it.
* For information on how to manage collections in Omeka, see: [http://omeka.org/codex/Managing_Collections]()

#### Building Exhibits
* The Exhibit Builder plug allows you to build online exhibits using items in your collections.
* An exhibit is a set of webpages that showcase a combination of digital objects in your Omeka archive with narrative text.
* Exhibits are built using the Omeka dashboard. Click the "exhibits" link in the left nav column to get started.
* For information on how to manage exhibits in Omeka, see: [http://omeka.org/codex/Plugins/ExhibitBuilder]()

####Simple Pages
* Another Omeka plugin that allows site managers to create simple webpages on there site.
* Use cases include about pages, contact pages, and the like.

###Metadata
* Metadata is information about an object (data about data). It allows users to discover, identify, and locate items. It also enables systems to sort and filter items to present during search and browse operations.
* In Omeka you can create metadata for collections and objects. 
* Omeka uses a metadata standard called Dublin Core. It is a set of elements used to describe an item. Some elements include Creator, Date, Title, Publisher, Description, and Rights.
* Other metadata standards can be used in Omeka with some configuration and customization.
