Is Kevin Bacon really the best actor to put at the center of the Kevin Bacon game? We'll find out by looking at a mini film datasetloaded into the NoSQL graph database Neo4j and using Cypher, the Neo4j query language, to find actors and movies, discover related actors and directors and once and for all, solve the Bacon Path question.
