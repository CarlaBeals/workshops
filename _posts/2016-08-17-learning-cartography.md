# Fundamentals of Cartography

## Learning Objectives
* Learn the basics of Cartography
* Develop understanding of the types of maps
* Review examples of types of maps

## What is Cartography?
Cartography is the science and aesthetic of map-making.  Given that maps are made up of static, tabular data at their core, it takes the artistic hand of the cartographer to display that data in a way that is not only pleasing to the eye, but also effective in making the argument presented.  Creating an effective map is akin to telling a story.  The map must be woven together in a way that gives purpose to every layer and that the user will be able to derive meaning.    

It is also the duty of the cartographer, to create a map that brings about spatial awareness in regards to the environment in which we live.  

## Elements to Consider When Making a map

One thing to consider when map-making, is what information you wan to present and for what purpose.  Who is the map being made for? For example, the type of map you would create for a journal publication would look drastically different from a map that you would make for a poster or conference presentation.  Organization, or how the information is presented, and scale (is local, regional or national scale appropriate?) are two other factors that may be useful to consider when making a map.

## Design Principles

There are several design principles that are necessary to consider when making a map.  Contrast, legibility, balance, color scheme, and symbology are all important design factors.
