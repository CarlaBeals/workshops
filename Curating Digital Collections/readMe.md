##Getting Started
Here are a few key concepts to get you started with Omeka. Links to documentation provide more detailed support.
#### Managing Items
* An item is a digital file(s) and its metadata record.
* An item can be included in one collection, or no collection.

* [Use this guide when inputting metadata](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W3QFz1HYHDCv5ieEVkrqPfhAvyHdFvzgjmyfiOar2yE/edit#gid=0)
* You may want to tag items: [http://omeka.org/codex/Managing_Tags]()
 
#### Managing Collections
* A collection is a group of items. Items may only belong to one collection a time.
* A collection has a metadata record describing it.

#### Building Exhibits
* The Exhibit Builder plug allows you to build online exhibits using items in your collections.
* An exhibit is a set of webpages that showcase a combination of digital objects in your Omeka archive with narrative text.
* Exhibits are built using the Omeka dashboard. Click the "exhibits" link in the left nav column to get started.
