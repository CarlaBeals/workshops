## Presentation:  
#### So, what are makerspaces? 

Well, you'll find dozens of definitions online, all of them a little bit different. But our working (and very loose) 
definition is:
* _Any location that is tied to a community and that focuses on creative experimentation between disciplines with a goal of
developing creative people that can approach problems in a new way._

#### What do they have to do with libraries?

Lots! The founding principles of makerspaces align directly with the goals for the future of libraries (see list below). 
Both libraries and makerspaces prioritize experience, idea exchange, collaboration, creative initiative, and the value of 
adaptability. Changes in technologies and educational design have helped teachers, instructors, universities, and informal 
learning centers realize that our spaces should be **transformational**, not transactional. "We are transitioning from a 
product-based economy to an experience-based one...Libraries will transition from a center of information, to a center of 
culture ([DaVinci Institute on the Future of Libraries](http://www.davinciinstitute.com/papers/the-future-of-libraries/))."

  * Participate

#### Why are they valuable?

Traditionally, makerspaces were focused primarily on science, technology, and engineering. But more than being about the 
technologies themselves, these spaces promoted "makers" to foster their creative process. Right now, the United States is 
seeing a continuing crisis in educating students in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. Here are some 
staggering statistics from the [National Math and Science Initiative](https://www.nms.org/AboutNMSI/TheSTEMCrisis/STEMEducationStatistics.aspx):

![Infographic of STEM Statistics](https://www.nms.org/portals/0/Images/infographics/info-graphic_StemCrisis2.png)
  * 38% of US Students change who declare STEM majors when entering college change to another discipline before graduating
  * 87% of Bachelor's degrees in engineering fields were held by men in 2008
  * 31% of U.S. bachelor's degrees were in science or engineering in 2008 (compared to 61% in Japan, 51% in China)
  * 12% of STEM workers were Black or Hispanic in 2008, despite accounting for 25% of the overall workforce

Meanwhile, jobs in computer and engineering fields are growing exponentially. The workforce in these areas is expected to 
grow 45% from its already high margins by 2018. And by that time, the U.S. maybe short as many as 3,000,000 high-skilled 
workers in this area. As educators, we are chronically failing to teach and empower students to see themselves as builders 
and creators, or to think creatively in their use and application of technology. This is important both inside and outside 
of traditional STEM disciplines.

Makerspaces can help to change this by offering tools that push people to think creatively, to collaborate and share resources to solve problems, and to be innovative and strategic. 
  
#### What if I am interested, but don't know much about technology?
  
That's great! In fact, everyone should get involved; it's not all about the tech! In 2011, Google did a [mangement study]
(http://www.thestreet.com/story/12328981/1/googles-project-oxygen-pumps-fresh-air-into-management.html) known as [_Project Oxygen_](https://prezi.com/f0pyxvrpwsbs/copy-of-google-project-oxygen/), which crunched data from all Google personnel 
back to 1998. It found that "technical expertise" didn't even make the list of the top skills of good managers! What did? Having a clear vision and strategy for your team, communicating well, actively listening, and being results-oriented and collaborative.
  
In 2008, the [Society for Human Resource Management](http://www.shrm.org/pages/default.aspx) worked with the Wall Street 
Journal to do a [survey](http://www.shrm.org/Research/SurveyFindings/Articles/Documents/Critical%20Skills%20Needs%20and%20Resources%20for%20the%20Changing%20Workforce%20Survey%20Report.pdf) of the skills most sought after for new entrants to the workforce (i.e. our students!). Almost all of them are skills that 
makerspaces focus on and address head-on! So, they're not just spaces for engineers and science geeks. The methods and skills they seek to foster are good for careers in all disciplines.

**Skills Most Sought After for New Entrants into the Workforce:**
  
  1. Flexibility/Adaptability
  2. Critical Thinking/Problem Solving
  3. Work Ethic and Time Management
  4. Computer and Technical Proficiency
  5. Teamwork and Collaboration
  6. Creativity and Innovation
  7. Communication Skills
  8. Analytical/Research Skills
  9. Leadership/Management Skills
  10. Ethics and Integrity in the Workplace
  
#### What do Makerspaces look like, and where are they?
  
Makerspaces are extremely diverse. One will look very different from the next. Some are commercial and operate on a 
business-model (i.e. you pay to be a member, and use the space for dedicated projects).  Others are pop-up style, or mobile, 
and aren't intended to be permanent. There are examples of heavy-duty labs with expensive, high-tech gear. And, of course, 
there are also low-tech labs that make things out of cheap, easily readible materials like legos, Knex, batteries and 
simple motors, cardboard boxes, and recycled materials. 

The [makerspace.com](http://makerspace.com/) website has a fairly current [directory of makerspaces](http://spaces.makerspace.com/makerspace-directory)
around the U.S. Also check out these makerspaces as examples:

## Workshop
#### Making ArtBots!

[Here](http://makezine.com/projects/scribble-machine/) are the instructions we used as guidelines in designing our workshop. To replicate it at home you'll need the following
materials:

![Image of Scribble Bot](https://makezineblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/scribblebots-5.jpg?w=620&h=413)

* 1 DC Motor (1.5-3 Volts)
* 1 AA battery
* 1 AA battery case ([like this](http://www.radioshack.com/radioshack-aa-battery-holder/2700401.html#.VMvnb2jF9yw))
* 3-4 markers
* 1 pencil eraser top (use as a propeller on the motor)
* Rubber bands
* Double-sided foam scotch tape
* Misc. art materials to decorate your bot (and give it a personality)
* Large sheet of paper (we used butcher paper in our workshop to cover the tables) for the bot to draw on!

If you try it out, let us know how it went for you! Tweet at us [@heardlibrary](https://twitter.com/heardlibrary) using the hashtag: #VandyDH
