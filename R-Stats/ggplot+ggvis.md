#Making Interactive Graphs with R

##Goals

R is an open source programming language for statistical analysis. In this session, weâ€™ll show you how to get started with creating graphs in R. In particular, we'll demonstrate how to use two popular alternative to the base graphics utilities in R: [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/) and [ggvis](http://ggvis.rstudio.com/). We'll talk about how these packages compliment each other as well as how they differ conceptually.

##Prerequisites

* Download the [R Programming Language](http://www.r-project.org/) in the version appropriate to your computer.
* Download the desktop version of [R Studio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/)
* Install the required packages (the code below is for our workshop laptops)

```R
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)

install.packages("RCurl")
library(RCurl)

install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)

install.packages("ggvis")
library(ggvis)

install.packages("scales")
library(scales)

install.packages("readxl")
library(readxl)
```

##Why R?

* R is open source, meaning that you can get started today without any upfront costs
* R is widely-used both here at Vanderbilt and globally for data analysis
* R has [a package (usually multiple packages!)](http://cran.r-project.org/) for nearly every kind of analysis
* Using R fosters [reproducible research](http://christophergandrud.github.io/RepResR-RStudio/index.html)

##R is a *Programming* Language

* R is a programming language, not a 'point-and-click' statistical application 
* RStudio provides a integrated development environment (IDE) for R, making its appearance more user-friendly 
* People use R in lots of different ways
  * from evaluating simple statistical functions in a [REPL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)
  * to developing interactive web applications with [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/)
* The combination of R & RStudio makes it possible to become production by learning a few functions and then develop expertise over time as necessary
  
##R Exercises

###[Average Heights and Weights for American Women](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/women.html)

We'll begin our explorations by rendering a simple graph with base graphics, ggplot2, and ggvis. This practice dataset of the average heights and weights for American women (ages 30-39) comes built in with the R programming language. Let's load the dataset into R and then explore it a little.

```R
# Assign the dataset to a variable
averages <- women

# explore the dataset
head(averages)
str(averages)
View(averages)
```

Now let's examine what how to make a scatter plot with this date using the built-in graphics package in R.

```R
attach(averages)
plot(weight, height, main="Average Heights and Weights of American Women", xlab="Weight", ylab="Height", pch=1)
```

We can also add a regression line to our plot by calling the `lines` function.

```R
lines(lowess(weight,height), col="blue")
```

The ggplot package allows us to produce the same graph, but provides a more consistent way to provide the data.

```R
# load ggplot 
library(ggplot2)

# plot the dataset
ggplot(averages, aes(x=weight, y=height)) + geom_point()

# plot the dataset with a trend line (linear regression)
ggplot(averages, aes(x=height, y=weight)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(method = "lm")
```

Finally, here's the same plot with regression line using the ggvis package.

```R
# load ggvis and dplyr
library(ggvis)
library(dplyr)

# plot the dataset
averages %>%
  ggvis(~weight, ~height) %>% 
  layer_points() %>%
  layer_smooths()
```

You may reasonably ask, why are there essentially three different ways of producing the same scatter plot? We'll answer that question as we move forward with our examples.

###[ARL Library Investment Index](http://www.arlstatistics.org/analytics)

This dataset from the Association for Research Libraries (ARL) contains key information about academic library budgets and staffing. An Excel (XLS) file is available [here](http://www.arlstatistics.org/documents/ARLStats/index15.xls). Please download the file and save it somewhere accessible on your system.

```R
# Load required libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(readxl)
library(scales)

# Load dataset from the Excel file
arl <- read_excel(file.choose(), sheet="e15", skip=1)

# Explore dataset
head(arl)
str(arl)
View(arl)

# Remove columns we do not want for our analysis
arl <- arl[,-c(1,2,3,9,10,11,12,13,14)]
View(arl)

# Remove row of extraneous data
arl <- arl[-115,]
View(arl)

# Changes names of columns for easier access 
names(arl)[c(1:5)] <- c("Institution", "Total", "Salaries", "Material", "Staff")
View(arl)

# Create a simple scatter plot
ggplot(arl, aes(x=Staff, y=Salaries)) + geom_point()

# Create a simple scatter plot (with trend line)
ggplot(arl, aes(x=Staff, y=Wages)) + geom_point()
ggplot(arl, aes(x=Staff, y=Wages)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(method="lm")

# Make the Y axes less cluttered
ggplot(arl, aes(x=Staff, y=Wages)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(method="lm") + scale_y_continuous(labels = comma)

# Add title
ggplot(arl, aes(x=Staff, y=Wages)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(method="lm") + scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) + main("ARL Salaries")
```

Of course, we're really interested to see where Vanderbilt appears on this trend line. Let's add another layer to our plot to highlight Vanderbilt in red.

```R
# Highlight Vanderbilt on the plot
# Thanks to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14351608/color-one-point-and-add-an-annotation-in-ggplot2/14351684#14351684

# First, create a subset of the data with only vanderbilt
Vandy <- subset(arl, Institution == "VANDERBILT")
View(Vandy)

# Then, create a scatter plot with a highlighted point for Vanderbilt
ggplot(arl, aes(x=Staff, y=Wages)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(method="lm") + scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) + ggtitle("ARL Salaries") + xlab("All Staff") + ylab("Professional Salaries") + geom_point(data=Vandy, colour="red")

```

Wouldn't it be nice as a next step to mark out points interactively? Here's where ggvis comes to the fore. We can use ggivs to set up an identical version of our graph with a dropdown box to select the library we'd like to highlight. 

```R
library(dplyr)
library(ggvis)
library(scales)

# data available at http://www.arlstatistics.org/documents/ARLStats/index15.xls
arl <- read_excel(file.choose(), sheet="e15", skip=1)
arl <- arl[,-c(1,2,3,9,10,11,12,13,14)]
arl <- arl[-115,]

names(arl)[c(1:5)] <- c("Institution", "Total", "Salaries", "Material", "Staff")
institutions <- as.vector(unique(arl$Institution))

arl %>%
    ggvis(~Staff, ~Total) %>% 
    layer_points() %>%
    layer_model_predictions(model = "lm", se = TRUE) %>%
    filter(Institution %in% eval(input_select(institutions, selected = 1))) %>%
    layer_points(fill := "red") 
```
