We’ll even build our own art bots! 

###Managing Your Online Scholarly Presence
####Friday, February 6
*Ed Warga*

* Social media has been making an impact on all our lives including how we work and maintain a professional network. This workshop offers some ideas for managing your online presence with researcher profiles, researcher IDs, and article level altmetrics. We will discuss options for researcher profiles like Google Scholar, Academia.edu, Researchgate, and Vivo; get started with researcher IDs to help link online content to an individual researcher; and explore how altmetrics allow you to identify important work by tracking citations and mentions of work in blogs, twitter, and other social networks. 

###Bringing Historical Maps into the Digital Age
####Friday, February 13

In this workshop we will cover the basics of georeferencing a map of your choosing, bring it into Tilemill for styling, and upload it to Mapbox. By the end of this short class, you will be able to georeference and serve out a map on your own!

###Introduction to Modding Minecraft Maps
####Friday, February 20

In this session, we'll show you how to write Minecraft *mods* (or modifications) using the open source toolkit [CanaryMod](http://canarymod.net/). Beyond teaching you how to write simple mods to alter the Minecraft game environment, we'll talk about potential uses for Minecraft as an educational technology.

###Introduction to Data Cleaning and Preservation
####Friday, March 20

###Degrees of Kevin Bacon: Basics of Network Analysis
####Friday, April 3
*Suellen Stringer-Hye*

* Is Kevin Bacon really the best actor to put at the center of the Kevin Bacon game? We'll find out by looking at a mini film dataset loaded into the NoSQL graph database [Neo4j](http://neo4j.com/) and using  [Cypher](http://neo4j.com/developer/cypher-query-language/), the Neo4j query language, to find actors and movies, discover related actors and directors and once and for all, solve the Bacon Path question.
